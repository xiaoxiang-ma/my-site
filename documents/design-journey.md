## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

The target audience for my website are job recruiters, my site will tell them about myself and why they should hire me.

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)

The feel should be direct and concise, without too much text or images. Features will include a "About me section" and a "Skills" section

### Final Content (Milestone 1)

Final content will include:
- About me
- Skills
- Experience
- Resume


## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)
The target audience are recruiters, they are interested in learning about me. The design goals for the audience will be concise, direct, and aesthetic. For the resume section, I planning on coding the actual resume in html so it can be available straight from my page.

### Site Theme (Milestone 2)
The site is low-key instead of flamboyant. I like a theme with a white background plus minimal/less use of colors, colors are only used as a tool to draw attention. Since the recruiters don't have a lot of time looking through my webpage, I will ultimately try and make all the information available in one page, and they can learn more about me by clicking links in the homepage, which would then direct them to detailed subpages.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
I considered two options for navigation:
1) Make viewer scroll down to see more content
2) Make a nav bar on top to take viewers to subpages
As of right now the nav is in a nav bar format, the end goal will be a single page with all the information presented in order so there is less effort needed for the recruiters to navigate.

### Organization (Milestone 2)
The organization came pretty clearly, I sorted the website by the most important features my employers would like to see, which are basically my projects, experience, and fun facts about me. These correspond to the portfolio, resume, and home pages.

## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)
I added styles to make the site look neat and clean. I picked a font that is easy to read and looks artistic. In terms of content, I re-arranged the portfolio page to make the information more presentable.

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)
I came to my visual designs based on simplicity and minimalism. The strengths are conveying information quickly and effectively, the weakness can be not visually appealing enough. They fit my overall goal and audience because my site is meant to be informative, not heavily artistic.
### Emotion (Milestone 3)
I am trying to convey a emotion of simplicity, everything is direct and easy to process.

## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)
Redesigned nav bar to make it more interactive. Redesigned portfolio page layout using flexbox. 

### Audience (Final Submission)
The intended audience are recruiters, they are interested in learning about me. They do not have a lot of time looking at my page, so the important parts must be easily visible and the structure must be easy to follow.
### Design Goals (Final Submission)
Since the site would be informative, I like a theme with a white background with little use of colors, colors are only used as a tool to draw attention. Since the recruiters don't have a lot of time looking through my webpage, all the basic information can be found in the homepage, if they are interested in learning more, they can click on nav bar to direct them to detailed subpages.

### Navigation (Final Submission)
The navigation rests on the top of the page with a hover color change. The bolded text and the horizontal line indicate to the viewers that this is a navigation bar to go to different pages.

### Organization (Final Submission)
The contents are organized by 3 parts: Home, Resume, and portfolio. These are the most representative information about myself.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)
The visual design is simplistic and minimalist, information is easily perceived and the flow of logic is seamless.
